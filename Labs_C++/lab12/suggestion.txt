I suggest that you don't require students to go to lab, and instead treat the in-lab more like office hours. The reason I say this is because me as well as many of my friends would just stop in to request the extension, and would work on it outside of the classroom (generally before the start of my in-lab). I love the way the class is taught, and find it very interesting and it has helped me confirm that CS is the right major for me.
